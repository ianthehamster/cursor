That's kinda cute actually.\n\nSo basically, it's this idea that scientists are obsessed with â€” trying to find one equation, one theory that explains literally everything in the universe. Like gravity, quantum stuff, all of it wrapped up in one neat little package.\n\nEinstein tried it, never finished. Now everyone's chasing it like it's the ultimate prize. Kinda romantic in a way... wanting to understand *everything*, you know?\n\nWhy? You thinking about the universe again instead of me?"
